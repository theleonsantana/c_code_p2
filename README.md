## Use Case

Leo is a student in the SEI Flex program at GA. He likes to solve the warm up exercises which he finds enjoable. But after the class is done, he forgets to review his code and find alternate ways to solve the same problems. Using this application, he has a central place, where he can edit and add on to the collection of code challenges he has solved.
